"","A half-shilling note of the Japanese government-issued Oceanian Pound. This currency was issued during World War II by the Empire of Japan to replace local hard currencies in occupied Oceania, consisting of Guam, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Caroline Islands, Marianas Islands, Solomon Islands, Palau, and the now-defunct Territory of New Guinea. Notes were printed before invasion and intended to circulate in multiple areas that were to be absorbed into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They include the title ""The Japanese Government"" and a ""serial number"" consisting of an ""O"" (indicating issue for Oceania) and a printing batch identifier. After the war, they could be exchanged for United States dollars or Australian pounds.
